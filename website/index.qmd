###### Highest Close
GameStop's stock price closed at $347.51, its highest close of the squeeze.

The U.S. equity and options trading volume reached its highest-ever single-day level.

Melvin Capital and Citron, two hedge funds that had been shorting GameStop stock, were forced to cover most of their short positions at huge losses.

###### 28 January 2021: 
###### Robinhood Restriction
Robinhood, a popular brokerage app among r/wallstreetbets investors restricted trading GME stock, meaning retail investors could only sell the stock and could no longer buy it.
