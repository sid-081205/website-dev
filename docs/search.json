      "text": "Introduction\nThe initial analysis corroborated what we knew about the GME event, with visualisations clearly delineating the saga and linking stock fluctuations to real-time events effectively.\nOur next goal was to dive deeper into the phenomenon of how a dispersed group mobilised for change. Based on prior literature, we aimed to understand how they engaged in ‘connective action’ (Bennet, 2012)1, where the subreddit engages in collective action emerging from the use of digital media. Importantly, this refers to (i) decentralised and personalised participation, (ii) where a narrative is pursued against the establishment. We believe the incident meets these criteria.\nThis analysis, new to us, sought to identify trends and themes that explained the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of their collective action, without a predetermined path for investigation."

This suggests an alignment with the initial surge in GME’s share price, indicating a period of heightened investor enthusiasm.\n\n\nFebruary Word Cloud\nFebruary: Words like “hold” and “now” emerge as dominant, reflecting ongoing interest in GME. This seems to support the narrative of investors holding onto their shares amidst market fluctuations, showcasing a collective resolve.\n\n\nMarch Word Cloud\nMarch: “Price” and “share” continue to be significant, complemented by the appearance of “million” and “sell.” This shift might denote discussions around profit-taking or evaluating the stock’s worth following its earlier rally, pointing to a more cautious or strategic approach by the community.\nThese insights are analogous to those speculated throughout our interactive timeline.\n\n\nIssues\nWhile word clouds provide an intuitive and visually appealing way to explore textual data, their reliance on the frequency of individual words can lead to oversimplification, especially with complex topics like the GME saga. This method overlooks the context in which words are used together, missing crucial nuances and the relationships between terms. Therefore, we felt it necessary to augment these word clouds with more advanced text analysis tools to grasp the subtleties and deeper insights of such discussions."

      "text": "LDA Analysis\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a type of statistical model used for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a large volume of data.\nLDA is an unsupervised learning technique, which means it doesn’t require pre-labelled training data. This makes it suitable for exploratory data analysis where the themes or topics are not known a priori.\nHowever, the “topics” unearthed through LDA, being distributions of words, may not always encapsulate coherent or meaningful themes without careful interpretation. Also, LDA does not take into account the evolution of topics over time, which is relevant for this dynamic dataset.\nRegardless, the LDA visualisation offered intriguing insights, revealing underlying patterns and themes that were not immediately apparent.\n\nScroll to view full plot, click here to view in separate window\n\n\n\nTerms like “moon,” “GME,” and “AMC” signal optimism towards rising stock prices, a perspective not captured in the word clouds. Similarly, “squeeze” and “hold” hint at trading strategy discussions, likely around short squeezes or maintaining positions through volatility.\n\nAdjusting the LDA model’s parameters, including the number of topics and iterations, enhanced our coherence score. In a refined analysis with five topics, the model’s output was as follows:\n\nTopic 1: Focused on actions related to stocks, particularly “buying” and “removing” with a strong focus on GME and AMC, indicating investment strategy discussions.\n\n\nTopic 4: Centred on the “short squeeze” narrative and optimism, with terms like “moon” and “squeeze” pointing to discussions on stock value surges.\n\n\nTopic 5: Related to trading timing, with advice on “buying dips” or “holding shares,” indicated by terms like “sell,” “tomorrow,” and “don’t stop”.\n\n\nUsing adjusted parameters, such as for three topics, the model’s output was as follows:\n\nTopic 1: Pertains to professional financial analysis, discussing company earnings, growth, and larger economic elements like policy impacts and sector advancements; e.g. “quarter,” “growth,” “sales,” and “earnings”.\n\n\nTopic 2: Reflects informal trading discussions on Reddit, intertwined with celebrity influence and cryptocurrency, emphasising buy/sell dynamics; e.g. “papa”, “musk”.\n\n\nTopic 3: Showcases individual financial narratives and community advice, marked by a blend of investment strategy talk and forum slang, such as “portfolio,” “money”, and “savings”.\n\n\n\nInsights\nLDA’s insights have been pivotal in unravelling the GME saga by showing how individual actors found common ground and formed a collective momentum, crucial aspects of connective action. The model revealed an alignment of interests and strategies, as terms like “moon,” “squeeze,” and “hold” reflect a shared optimism and a collective approach to trading.\nThe LDA model pinpointed key phrases like “moon,” “squeeze,” and “hold” as unifiers within the GME community, illustrating how these terms helped coordinate individual efforts into collective action. This analysis provided concrete insights into the group’s strategy, demonstrating the dynamics of connective action where digital platforms were used to align individual actions against market norms."

The graph concisely shows how GME’s stock price, trading volume, and Reddit discussions moved in sync, highlighting the influence of investor sentiment on the market.\nThe plot reveals how periods of heightened Reddit activity align with spikes in both stock price and trading volume, suggesting a correlation between online sentiment and market movements.\nThe size of the circles, denoting the total number of Reddit posts, generally increases with trading volume, implying more discussions on days with heavy trading. Similarly, darker circles, indicating more comments, tend to appear alongside significant shifts in the stock’s closing price. This pattern suggests that as the stock captured more attention, it resulted in not only more posts but also more in-depth discussions on Reddit.\n\nKey Highlights\nJanuary 22nd, when GME’s stock surged by over 50%, closing at $65.01 as the short interest reached an astounding 140%. The graph shows a corresponding increase in Reddit activity, underscoring the online community’s role in the stock’s performance.\nThe climax of the graph is January 27th, the date of GameStop’s highest close at $347.51, a result compounded by a short squeeze that forced institutions like Melvin Capital and Citron to cover their shorts at significant losses. The next day, Robinhood restricted GME trading, leading to a price drop and widespread allegations of market manipulation.\nThe visual data reveals that on February 4th, with trading restrictions lifted, the stock did not immediately recover, hitting a post-squeeze low of $40.59 by February 19th. However, online discussions remained robust, as evidenced by the high volume of comments.\nLater, on February 24th, a congressional hearing was held to dissect the impact of such online communities, but the stock had not yet settled, reaching a post-squeeze high of $264.52 on March 10th.\nThe graph succinctly encapsulates this period, illustrating the rapid shifts in stock price alongside the fluctuating intensity of Reddit discussions, serving as a testament to the profound impact social media can have on financial markets.",
